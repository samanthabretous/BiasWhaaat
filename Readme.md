Bias Whaaat helps users discover bias in their comments by highlighting gender biased words and providing alternative ones. With 5 million Slack users, we want to change the approach to "diversity training" in the workplace. Our goal is to make people conscious of biased language so better habits could be formed.

Technology Used: 
- Slack API
- ExpressJS
- Wit.ai
- JavaScript ES6
- Axios
